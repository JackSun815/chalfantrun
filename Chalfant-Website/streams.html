                        <p>Pennsylvania’s bituminous coal industry was born about 1760 on Coal  Hill, now Mt. Washington. Here the Pittsburgh coal bed was mined to supply Fort Pitt. This was eventually to be judged the most valuable individual mineral deposit in the US.

                        <p>"Most of the hills on both sides of the Ohio are filled with excellent coal and a coal mine was in the year 1760 opened opposite Fort Pitt on the River Monongahela for the use of the Garrison."  <br><br>--Captain Adam Stephen 1759 FORT DU QUESNE

                        On November 2, 1919, the Great Falls Daily Tribune published that around 394,000 bituminous miners out of a total of 615,000 employed by the coal industry were on strike, with the number of Pennsylvania strikers at the highest, at 100,000. <br><br>
                        By December, the nationwide coal strike ended, but a national coal conservation order, restricting use of coal everywhere except in private homes, went into effect under rigid enforcement.  </p>

                        Influenced by a similar policy introduced in St. Louis four years earlier, the city of Pittsburgh passed a law designed to reduce coal production in pursuit of cleaner air. Not willing to cripple such an important part of the local economy, it promised to clean the air by using treated local coal.
