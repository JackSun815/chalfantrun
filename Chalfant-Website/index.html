                <h2>Firefly Hike</h2>
                <p>Whether we know it or not, we all live in a watershed. The raindrops that fall in our lawns, fields, woods and parking lots ultimately flow into a creek or stream. As a result, the actions we take and the decisions we make with how we use, manage, conserve and value water impact the needs of those downstream, including our fish and wildlife. Our aquifers, springs, creeks, and rivers need you more than ever.
                <br><br>
                Come join us this Friday to explore what nature has to offer. This is a paved trail hike, led by our expert guide, Don!

                <h2>Meet the Engineer</h2>
                <p>Our goal is to protect and clean up our waterways so that they are vibrant, life-giving streams again, places of beauty and awe that welcome reflection. We have to, have to, have to engage our neighbors in this process or it won't work. Nature must be loved to be protected and so we aim to foster a deep connection between our neighbors and their watershed and the life it supports.
                    <br><br>
                    Come learn more about the Abandoned Mine Drainage that we have been battling against and hear from one of our engineers who is working on protecting the watershed.

                <h2>Community Needs Assessment</h2>
                <p>What matters to you in building a green community? Is it teh clean stremas? The family friendly trails? Or a restored biodiversity?
                The Chalfant Run Thompson Run Watershed Association is trying to understand our community needs and wants. We strive to move forward protecting, preserving and restoring our local streams and green spaces.
